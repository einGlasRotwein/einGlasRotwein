Hi, I'm Juli Nagel, a PhD student in the research group [Psychology and Neurobiology of Sleep and Memory](https://www.zi-mannheim.de/forschung/abteilungen-ags-institute/klinpsych/arbeitsgruppen-klinpsych/psych-neurobio-sleep-memory.html) 
at the Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim, Germany. 
I'm mainly interested in the influence of reward on memory, but also investigate the effect of sleep on memory.

My favourite language is `R`, but since I run a lot of online studies, I also know a bit of web stuff like JavaScript (and [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/)), PHP, SQL, and the odd bits of html and css.

You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@juli_nagel">Mastodon</a>.
